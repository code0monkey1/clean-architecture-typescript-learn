## Motivation to use `Clean Architecture`

**As software complexity grows , so does the overhead of one changing any of the fundamental parts in the given software .**

> One change can cause a ripple effect throughout the whole software system , leading to many changes , hence potentially many bugs , during refactoring

_A great way to manage complexity is to arrange the code into layers of abstraction ,
with the lower layers not knowing about the concrete implementation of the upper layers
, and them communicating with each other only through adapters ( abstract interfaces )._

**This way , one can easily make changes to any of the layers at any time , and
there would be no need for multilayer changes , as the shape of the adapters ( abstract interfaces ) would never be changed , and only the concrete implementation in a specific layer would be modified.**

If everything goes well in the architectural process , we end up with software layers that are independent of the specificities of the type of UI used , the concrete implementation of the Data Base used
etc ...

**i.e : We could swap out any of the concrete implementations, `the Data Base` , for example at any time , and substitute it with another implementation  ( eg Switching MongoDb with MySql ) , and there would be no change in implementation required to any of the lower layers of our application**

> What's more , every layer of our architecture can be tested independently.
>
> Thereby aiding a quick `TDD Process`

## Ports /  Adapters / Devices

>_A practical and useful implementation of the dependency inversion principle_

---

### 1 . Ports

<img src='./pictures/port.jpeg' width="300" height="300"/>

_Ports are the interfaces to which adapters can connect to_

In code , it means we create an interface that specifies the function that is supposed to be performed

In the case of a charging port , it's function is to charge a device.

---

```typescript

//Port 

interface ChargeDevice{
     
//behavior

     charge(device:TDevice):void;
     
}

```

---

### 2 . Adapters

<img src='./pictures/phoneAdapter.jpeg' width="300" height="300"/>

_Adapters are concrete implemantations , that are specific to the device being used. They are the link connecting a device to the port_

```typescript
//MacBook Adapter

class MacBookCharger implements ChargeDevice{

  charge(device: TDevice ): void {

      console.log("💻 💻 💻 💻 💻 💻")
      console.log("Charging : ",device.name," of pin type : ",device.pinType)
      console.log("🍎 🍎 🍎 🍏 🍏 🍏")

      for(let i =0;i<=100;i+=10)
         console.log(`Current Charge : ${i} %`)

  }
  
}
//Phone Adapter
class PhoneCharger implements ChargeDevice{

  charge(device: TDevice): void {
      console.log("📱 📱 📱  📱 📱 📱")
      console.log(`Charging : ${device.name}, \n of pin type : ${device.pinType}`)
      console.log("🤖 🤖 🤖 🤖 🤖 🤖 ")
  }

}
```

---

### 3 . Devices

<img src='./pictures/macbookDevice.webp' width="300" height="300"/>

<img src='./pictures/pixelPhoneDevice.jpg' width="300" height="300"/>

_This is the concrete implementation
that plugs into the adapter in order to communicate with the port_

```typescript
In Typescript Code , this is how we'd
go about defining the Device Type 

//Device ( Entity )

 type TDevice={

  name: string,
  pinType:"2 pin"|"3 pin"

}
```

---

## The Whole Setup in Action

### `UseCase : ChargeDevice`

  | PORT | ADAPTER | DEVICE | USE CASE INSTANCE |
  |:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
  |ChargeDevice|MacBookCharger|MacBook|ChargeMacBook|
  |ChargeDevice|PhoneCharger|PixelPhone|ChargePhone|
  
  ---

<img src='./pictures/macbookCharging.jpg' width="300" height="300"/>

---

<img src='./pictures/phoneCharging.jpg' width="300" height="300"/>

```typescript

// Charging a Device
class ChargeDeviceUseCase {
     
  constructor(private readonly adapter : ChargeDevice) {}

   execute( device : TDevice){
     this.adapter.charge(device);
   }

}

const PixelPhone:TDevice={
  name:"Google Pixel",
  pinType:"3 pin"
}

const MacBook:TDevice={
  name:"MacBook Pro",
  pinType:"2 pin"
}

const PhoneAdapter = new PhoneCharger()

const MacBookAdapter = new MacBookCharger()


const ChargePhone =  new ChargeDeviceUseCase(PhoneAdapter)

ChargePhone.execute(PixelPhone)

const ChargeMacBook = new ChargeDeviceUseCase(MacBookAdapter)

ChargeMacBook.execute(MacBook)

// Output

/* 
📱 📱 📱  📱 📱 📱

 of pin type : 3 pin
🤖 🤖 🤖 🤖 🤖 🤖 

//--------------------------------

## The Dependency Rule

> " The name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle . That includes, functions, classes, variables, or any other named software entity. "
>
>Data formats used in an outer circle should not be used by an inner circle. We don’t want anything in an outer circle to impact the inner circles.
>
> -- Uncle Bob

It is imperative that we ensure that none of the structures in the inner layers can know about any of the outer layers, but the outer layers `can and should` know about the inner layers .

In other words , `Source code dependencies can only point inwards , and not outwards`

i.e  It is ok for `UseCase` structures to know about `Entities` , but it's not ok the other way around .

However , the communication between the different layers will always take place through interfaces , and never directly.

This objective is easily achieved by applying the `Dependency Inversion Principle`

## Setting up a `Node.js + Typescript` project with `Clean Architecture`

### Steps

1. Initiate node project using `npm init -y` , which will create the `package.json` file with the default settings.

1. Create folders `src` and `test`.
  
1. Integrate typescript into the project by using `npm i -D typescript @types/node` , which installs typescript as a dev dependency , and the node type declarations to make working with node using typescript compatible.

1. To initialize all the tooling for this typescript node project, run `npx tsc --init` , which will create the `tsconfig.json` file with the default settings.

1. Within the newly created tsconfig.json file, go to `outDir` option , and select the folder to which the compiled javascript compiled will be put into. We choose a folder name `dist` for this purpose _( you could name it whatever you want )_.

    ```json
    "outDir": "./dist"
    ```

1. Next set up the `baseUrl` option in the `tsconfig.json` file to be `src`.

    ```json
     "baseUrl": "./src"
    ```

1. Next set the directory references using `paths` attribute in the `tsconfig.json` file, which will allow us to easily reference different files in our project.
All these modules will be set in reference to the `baseUrl (i.e : src)` in our particular case

    >This is how we'll be able to reference files in our project after setting up the `paths` attribute eg : `import CreateUserUseCase from'@application/useCases/CreateUserUseCase'` rather than using something like `import CreateUserUseCase from './src/application/useCases/CreateUserUseCase'`

      ```json
      //tsconfig.json

      "paths": {
      "@domain/_":["domain/_"],
      "@application/_":["application/_"],
      "@infrastructure/_":["infrastructure/_"],
      "@main/_":["main/_"],
      "@test/_":["../test/_"],
    }
      ```

    > In this above code block , we set 5 different    directory references for 5 folders we are about to create in the next few steps.  
    >
    >Keep in mind that all of these folders are placed relative to the `baseUrl (i.e. ./src)` , in our case .
    >
    >So, for example the `@test` reference will refer to the test folder inside our project , which is one folder above our src folder , hence this `["../test/_"]` is how we specify it's relative position w.r.t our `baseUrl (src)`.
    >
    >`domain` , `application` and `infrastructure` are the 3 separate layers in our clean architecture setup .
    >
    >The `main` layer serves as the entry point for our application , and will have the `server.ts` file , which would start out application.
    >
    >Finally the `test` layer will contain all our `unit` and `integration` test files.

1. Next , go on and create all the above mentioned folders in the src folder `domain` , `application` , `infrastructure` , `main` , and also create a `server.ts` file within the `main` folder. The `test` folder will be created outside the src folder.

1. Now , we need to specify `rootDirs` attribute in the `tsconfig.json` file , which specifies where all the typescript files would be located in our project.
This would have our `src` and `test` folder , which  contain all our typescript files.

    ```json
        "rootDirs": [
              "src",
              "test"
            ]
    ```

1. Next we specify the folders that we want to be included for the compilation process during `development`, and  the `build` phase. During the development phase , it makes sense to include the `test` files for compilation.So, go to the `include` attribute in the `tsconfig.json` file, and include the `src` and `test` folders .

    ```json
        "include": [
            "src",
            "test"
          ]
     ```

1. However, the `test` files  should be excluded in the `build` phase , as test files are not useful for deployment purposes.

      - For this we will create an extra `tsconfig` file by the name of : `tsconfig-build.json` ( the configuration for the build phase ) , which will inherit all the configuration from the `tsconfig.json` file, but will exclude the `test` files for compilation during `build` time.

         ```json
            {
              "extends":"./tsconfig.json",
              "exclude": ["test"]
            }
         ```

1. Next , we update our `package.json` file to use the compiled `javascript` files for running the application, by setting the `main` attribute in `package.json` to `dist/main/server.js` , so that our node app uses `server.js` to run the application.

      ```json

       "main": "dist/main/server.js"
      ```

1. Now we install the `rimraf` package (dev dependency) ( used to remove the older `dist` folder before creating a new one ) , to help us during the build process  `npm i -D rimraf`. And then we write our build script using this package.

    ```json
      \\package.json

      "build": "rimraf dist && tsc -p tsconfig-build.json",
      "build:watch":"npm run build -- --watch",
    ```

    >The `rimraf` package provides a cross-platform solution for deleting files and folders, which can be useful if you are working on a project that needs to run on multiple operating systems.
    >
    > By running the build command, we are able to  compile fresh files and folders using the typescript configurations for build time ( which does not include unnecessary files like `test` by using the `tsconfig-build.json` file )

1. For the build process to recognize the reference to our files defined in the  `paths` property of the project , we need to install a package known as `module-alias` to our project as a production dependency.

      ```bash
        npm i module-alias
      ```

      1. Next, we import `module-alias/register` at the top of the `server.ts` file in the `main` folder inside the `src` directory.

          ```typescript
               \\serve.ts
               
            import 'module-alias/register';
          
          ```

      1. For the `module-alias` package to recognize our defined package structure , during build time, our files, we need to create a mapping  similar to the tsconfig.json file structure in our package.json file .

      1. Next, we define a file  structure similar to the one we defined in the tsconfig.json file in our `package.json` file, which references the compiled `.js` files in the `dist` folder which will eventually be used in production. Notice we didn't include the `tests` directory , as it's not required in production.

           ```json
            \\package.json

            "_moduleAliases": {
              "@domain": "./dist/domain",
              "@application": "./dist/application",
              "@infrastructure": "./dist/infrastructure",
              "@main": "./dist/main"
            }
           ```

1. Install `nodemon` as a dev dependency for instant feedback on code change during development

     ```bash
      npm i -D nodemon
     ```

1. Install the `concurrently` package as a prod dependency , as it allows multiple npm commands to run simultaneously , so that we can `build` our project , and also at the same time `watch` our built project once it's built .

      ```console

        npm i concurrently
      ```

      ```json
        // package.json
        
        "dev": "nodemon -L --watch  ./dist ./dist/main/server.js",
   
        "start:dev": "concurrently --kill-others-on-fail \"npm run build:watch\" \"npm run dev\"" ,
      ```

1. Now we start with setting up the test environment using the `jest` library , and also installing the `@types/jest` for typescript support.

      1. Install both as `dev dependencies`

          ```console
            npm i -D jest @types/jest
          ```

      1. Now initiate jest files by running the following command:

           ```console
            ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --init
           ```

          <img src='./pictures/jest_coverage.jpg' alt='coverage' width='auto' height='300' />

      1. Now we go to the generated `jest.config.js` file and go to  the `collectCoverageFrom` property to set  which all folders and files will be evaluated for test coverage. We do not include the `main` folder in the test coverage as it will mainly include glue-code , whose functionality can be tested better with integration tests, which we will be adding later.

          ```json
          //jest.config.js
  
            collectCoverageFrom: [
            '<rootDir>/src/**/*.ts',
            '!<rootDir>/src/main/**/*.ts',
                  ]
          ```

      1. Set the name of the coverage directory using the `coverageDirectory` property , and set it to a folder with the name `coverage`

          ```json
              coverageDirectory: "coverage",
          ```

      1. Next , we set the property `moduleNameMapper` , which maps the name of the modules we've defined , i.e `domain` `application` etc , with respect to the `<rootDir>` i.e the root directory of our project. Here the `$1` is a placeholder for the folder/file names that come in that path.
  
          ```json
           //jest.config.js
           
            moduleNameMapper: {
              "@domain/(.*)": "<rootDir>/src/domain/$1",
              "@application/(.*)": "<rootDir>/src/application/$1",
              "@infrastructure/(.*)": "<rootDir>/src/infrastructure/$1",
              "@main/(.*)": "<rootDir>/src/main/$1",
              "@test/(.*)": "<rootDir>/test/$1",
             },
          ```

      1. Next we define the `roots` property , which will point to the folder that contains all the files that need to be tested by jest.So, we need to test all files in the `test` folder in our `root directory`

          ```json
             //jest.config.js

             roots: [
              "<rootDir>/test/",
            ],

          ```

      1. Next ,in order to use typescript files in jest , without any type errors , we need to install the library `ts-jest` as a dev dependency.

         ```terminal
          npm install --save-dev ts-jest
         ```

      1. Now in the we need to add support for typescript files in test , in the `jest.config.js` file .

          ```json
             //jest.config.js
             
              //this will come at the top of the file outside the `module.exports` function

             const { defaults: tsjPreset } = require('ts-jest/presets')
            
              //the transform property will me modified likewise   
    
              transform: {
              ...tsjPreset.transform,
              },
          ```

      1. Finally add the scripts in the `package.json` file for running tests in various scenarios . One is for normal testing , the other test is for the `staged` state, and comparing to previously written tests, and the last in for generating the `code coverage`.

          ```json
            \\package.json
            
            "test": "jest --passWithNoTests --runInBand --no-cache",
            "test:stage":"npm run test -- --findRelatedTests",
            "test:ci":"npm run test -- --coverage"
          ```

1. Setting up `esLint` for our project :

     1. Configure  `eslint` by typing the following command in the terminal

     ```terminal
             npm init @eslint/config
     ```

      <img src='./pictures/eslint-config.jpg' alt="eslint-configuration" height="300" width="auto">

    1. In our `.gitignore` file, we need to add `node_modules` , `dist` and `coverage` folders.

        ```terminal
        \\ .gitignore
        node_modules
        dist
        coverage

        ```

    1. Now we create a script  in our `package.json` file for linting using `eslint`. In this file , we re-use the existing information in the `.gitignore` file to avoid linting the ignored files.

     ```json
      \\package.json

      "lint":"eslint --ignore-path .gitignore --ext .ts --fix"
     ```
